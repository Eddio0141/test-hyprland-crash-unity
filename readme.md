The smallest unity project I could make that causes Xwayland to crash on hyprland
---
This only works on Hyprland

# Steps
1. Open VRM0 on the top
2. Click "Export VRM 0.x..."
3. Where it says "None (Game Object)", look to the right and click the circle thing, this opens another window
4. Click "Assets" and "Scene", maybe a few times
5. Xwayland crashes (at least on my pc)
